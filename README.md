## Mushroom Edibility Predictor

The starter code was generated using [expo](https://expo.dev/). **Do *not* re-run the expo init command**. After entering this directory and adding the sizeModel.pkl to your root directory, simply run...

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
npm install
npm start
```

To launch the app, there are a few options. If you have a smart device, I would recommend using the expo app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US). You can scan the QR code using your phone, or you can launch commands via the terminal. Otherwise, you can use an emulator (such as [AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator))
